# Newton Physics

Newton is an open-source, GPU-accelerated, and extensible physics engine to advance robot learning and development.

Built on [NVIDIA Warp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp), a developer framework for building and accelerating simulation and spatial computing, Newton enables robots to acquire and refine physical intelligence in a safe, virtual environment. Newton is compatible with learning frameworks such as [MuJoCo Playground](https://playground.mujoco.org/) and [NVIDIA Isaac Lab](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/lab).

For additional resources, refer to the [Newton Physics Documentation](https://newton-physics.github.io/newton/guide/overview.html) and [Newton Repository Readme](https://github.com/newton-physics/newton?tab=readme-ov-file#newton).
